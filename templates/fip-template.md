## Simple Summary
Brief, one-paragraph explanation of the proposal in simple terms.

## Abstract
Technical summary of the proposal (200 words max). This should be a clear, concise description of what the FIP proposes.

## Motivation
Why is this FIP necessary? What problem does it solve? What use cases does it address?

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature in detail. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the F1R3FLY.io platform.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Backwards Compatibility
All FIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The FIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs that affect consensus changes. Tests should either be inlined in the FIP as data (such as input/expected output pairs) or included in `../assets/fip-###/<filename>`.

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.

## Security Considerations
All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal.
