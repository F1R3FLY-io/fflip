# F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposals (FIP)

This repository is the home for F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposals. FIPs are design documents describing standards for the F1R3FLY.io platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, consensus mechanisms, and application-level standards.

## Repository Status

**This repository is currently being initialized.** The FIP process framework is being established following industry standards from:
- EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)
- BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)
- PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)

## What is a FIP?

A F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposal (FIP) is a design document that:
- Provides information to the F1R3FLY.io community
- Describes a new feature, process, or environment change
- Includes concise technical specifications and rationale

FIPs will be the primary mechanism for:
- Proposing new features
- Collecting community input
- Documenting design decisions

## FIP Categories

FIPs will be organized into these categories:

```yaml
Core: "Consensus-affecting changes to RNode and core protocols"
Networking: "Network protocol improvements"
Interface: "Language-level standards and APIs (Rholang, client APIs)"
Application: "Application-level standards and conventions"
Meta: "Process proposals and governance changes"
Informational: "Guidelines and design documentation"
```

## FIP Statuses

```yaml
Draft: "Initial submission, open for changes"
Review: "Ready for peer review and discussion"
Last Call: "Final review period (typically 14 days)"
Final: "Accepted standard"
Withdrawn: "Author has withdrawn the proposal"
Superseded: "Replaced by another FIP"
```

## Current Contents

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**: Comprehensive AI assistant context defining FIP standards, processes, and best practices
- **README.md**: This overview document

## Next Steps

To complete repository initialization:

1. Create FIPS/ directory structure
2. Write FIP-1 (Meta: FIP Purpose and Guidelines)
3. Create FIP template in templates/
4. Add LICENSE file (Apache 2.0)
5. Establish FIP editor roles
6. Configure GitHub Discussions
7. Set up repository labels and workflows

## F1R3FLY.io Ecosystem

FIPs may propose changes to any F1R3FLY.io project, including:

```yaml
Core Platform:
  f1r3fly: "Main transaction server (Scala/Rust)"

Language & Tools:
  rholang_rs: "Rholang interpreter (Rust)"
  rholang_language_server: "LSP for Rholang (Rust)"
  graph_to_rholang_parser: "Graph to Rholang parser (Rust)"

Applications:
  embers: "F1R3Sky wallets and agents (Rust)"
  embers_frontend: "Web interface (TypeScript)"
  f1r3sky: "Decentralized social platform (TypeScript)"

Developer Tools:
  lightning_bug: "Browser-based code editor (Clojure)"
  F1r3bu1ld3r: "Infrastructure visualization tool"
```
