# F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposals (FIP)

This repository is the home for F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposals. FIPs are design documents describing standards for the F1R3FLY.io platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, consensus mechanisms, and application-level standards.

## Repository Status

**This repository is currently being initialized.** The FIP process framework is being established following industry standards from:
- EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)
- BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals)
- PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)

## What is a FIP?

A F1R3FLY.io Improvement Proposal (FIP) is a design document that:
- Provides information to the F1R3FLY.io community
- Describes a new feature, process, or environment change
- Includes concise technical specifications and rationale

FIPs will be the primary mechanism for:
- Proposing new features
- Collecting community input
- Documenting design decisions

## FIP Categories

FIPs will be organized into these categories:

```yaml
Core: "Consensus-affecting changes to RNode and core protocols"
Networking: "Network protocol improvements"
Interface: "Language-level standards and APIs (Rholang, client APIs)"
Application: "Application-level standards and conventions"
Meta: "Process proposals and governance changes"
Informational: "Guidelines and design documentation"
```

## FIP Statuses

```yaml
Draft: "Initial submission, open for changes"
Review: "Ready for peer review and discussion"
Last Call: "Final review period (typically 14 days)"
Final: "Accepted standard"
Withdrawn: "Author has withdrawn the proposal"
Superseded: "Replaced by another FIP"
```

## Getting Started

### Proposing a New FIP

1. **Review Existing FIPs**: Check [FIP_INDEX.md](FIP_INDEX.md) to see what's been proposed
2. **Discuss Your Idea**: Use GitHub Discussions to vet your concept with the community
3. **Draft Your FIP**: Copy [templates/fip-template.md](templates/fip-template.md) to `FIPS/fip-N.md`
4. **Submit for Review**: Create a pull request with your proposal
5. **Iterate**: Incorporate feedback and refine your FIP

### Understanding the FIP Process

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive details on:
- FIP lifecycle and status transitions
- Required sections and formatting standards
- Review and approval process
- Best practices for FIP authorship

## Next Steps for Repository Development

1. Write FIP-1 (Meta: FIP Purpose and Guidelines)
2. Establish FIP editor roles and responsibilities
3. Configure GitHub Discussions for proposal feedback
4. Set up repository labels for FIP categories and statuses
5. Create GitHub Actions workflows for FIP validation

## F1R3FLY.io Ecosystem

FIPs may propose changes to any F1R3FLY.io project, including:

```yaml

  rholang_language_server: "LSP for Rholang (Rust)"
  graph_to_rholang_parser: "Graph to Rholang parser (Rust)"

Applications:
  embers: "F1R3Sky wallets and agents (Rust)"
  embers_frontend: "Web interface (TypeScript)"
  f1r3sky: "Decentralized social platform (TypeScript)"

Developer Tools:
